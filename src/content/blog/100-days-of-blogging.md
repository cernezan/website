It's almost 10 p.m. I'm currently at the seaside, enjoying my vacation. It's hot, and a fan called 'Giovanni' is blowing in my face. It's calm, and I feel good.

I've been thinking about the idea of 100 days of blogging - where I would write 100 blog posts in 365 days. Basically, I want to join the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) challenge, but I want to call it "100 days of blogging".

Ah, let's do it. It sounds intriguing enough that I want to give it a go. Here are a few reasons why I want to do the 100 days of blogging:

* I want to improve my writing.
* I want to write more and share more of my thoughts, ideas, and learnings.
* I want to grow - and I think daily posts will force me to learn or experience something new or interesting that I can write about.
* I have a lot of personal challenges and in-progress projects that I want to write about.

To follow the rules of the original 100 days to offload, I will toot my blog posts on [my Mastodon account](https://toot.io/@zan). See you tomorrow.
