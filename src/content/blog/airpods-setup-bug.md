For two weeks in a row, I have been getting this weird bug with my AirPods Pro. I use them daily and have them set up in the Find My app. But from time to time, the AirPods “soft reset” the Find My setup, stating “AirPods Setup Incomplete”. This then causes a warning notification that unknown AirPods are following me whenever I move.

It's just annoying. I have tried everything to combat this, including completely resetting them to factory settings, but nothing seems to help so far.
