Hello everyone. I've been developing and redesigning my own website since a few months ago, but I didn't like the final result. I never published it and now I want to start this project again, but with a slight difference - I want to build it in public.

Maybe my progress won't be huge, but since this is already publicly available I want to deploy new and improved versions more regularly and slowly get to the well rounded personal website and blog I always wanted.

I'm sure I will learn a lot and I want to blog about the experience. That's it for now. In the upcoming days, I plan to showcase my never released version of the website and write a bit more about the tech stack of this new one.
