I enjoy building small projects, ranging from web apps to simple websites like this one. Recently, I've also started learning a bit of iOS development and I'm almost finished with a starter course. Overall, I'm quite excited, but this past week was so hectic that I could barely find the time for some coding.

I want to continue building small projects. However, I've learned that whether you're a small startup, a big corporation, or an individual maker (like myself), you should aim to create something people want (that might even include yourself). I understand how general and simple this idea sounds, but so often, I see proposed products that just no one will ever use. It could be that I'm just a bit more cynical.

A week ago, I read a post titled "[What should you build? Or how not to come up with your startup idea](https://exponentially.substack.com/p/what-should-you-build)" and it really got me thinking about the what's and why's of my projects. Definitely, it's something I want to keep in mind for my future endeavors.
