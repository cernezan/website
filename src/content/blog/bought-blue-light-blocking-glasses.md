Yesterday, I purchased blue-light blocking glasses. I had been on the edge of trying them out, mostly because I thought it was all a gimmick. After doing some research and learning that [Bryan Johnson](https://www.bryanjohnson.co/) uses them, I decided to give them a try. I chose to go with the Whoop blue-light blocking glasses for evening use, since I didn’t want to get the cheapest off-brand ones.

Recently, I’ve been experimenting with different gadgets, programs, protocols, and supplements to further enhance my life. I want to write publicly about the progress and results from these experiments, since I think the information can be of value to some.
