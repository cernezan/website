Today, I went on a one-day trip with my family to the Soƒça Valley. It was beautiful and hot, but thankfully we refreshed ourselves by swimming in an ice-cold river. The experience was amazing. I've realized I enjoy swimming in rivers (that are clean).

This summer, I already swam in rivers three times. There's just something about nature and refreshing cold water that makes me feel amazing and excited. Here's a photo from today's swim:

I also went on a simple 5km run as part of my [7-Day Running Challenge](https://www.cernezan.com/blog/my-7-day-running-challenge/). I enjoyed it more than expected. Below is the screenshot of my heart rate during today's run.
