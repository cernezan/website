I've updated the site with small improvements as well as adding pagination for the blog. I already have some additional improvements and features I want to add.

Quick update for the [7-day internet consumption reset](https://cernezan.com/blog/7-day-internet-consumption-reset/): it's going okay. It's not that bad, but I definitely had to change some of my behaviors. For now, this seems like a really useful challenge. More updates to follow.
