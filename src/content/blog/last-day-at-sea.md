Today, I started writing a lengthy piece about Apple Podcasts and the idea of a similar platform but for personal blogs. I didn't finish it as we're packing to return home from a week-long vacation by the sea. However, worry not, I will publish it in the upcoming days. As mentioned yesterday, I also aim to introduce a few small improvements to my blog, but today, I simply wanted to enjoy the day.

[Joel G.](https://fosstodon.org/@joel) on Mastodon recommended adding some kind of badge signifying the day of the challenge, which would motivate me as well as engage the visitors.

Oh, and if you didn't know, I joined the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge, or as I like to call it, 100 days of blogging. Welcome aboard.
