My running preparations are going well. Today, I went on another 7km run. I've also registered for a 10km race in my hometown happening at the end of August. This will help me prepare better for the upcoming Ljubljana 10km race in October. My hometown race will give me a better understanding of my current race pace and areas I need to improve on for the October race.

During the weekend, I plan to write a more detailed post explaining my current training plan for running and share my learnings. I've also noticed that I haven't posted many technical articles, so I might do a small write-up on something I've learned recently as well.
