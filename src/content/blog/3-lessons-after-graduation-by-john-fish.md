These are just my own notes on John Fish's video called "[3 Lessons for Life After Graduation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pxMa_aADZ4)". I wrote them for myself, but I realize that someone else might find them valuable as well.

## Choose Your Path or a Path Will Choose You

* Everyone worships something, and if you don't choose your path, you'll be absorbed by one.
* Defining your path is crucial.
* Choosing your path empowers you to push it in the direction you want to go.
* Outside of school, there are countless paths to follow, so you have to choose.
* Not choosing your path will not lead to fulfillment.

### How to Choose a Path?

* Consider where you're coming from.
* Consider what you value and what's non-negotiable for you.
* Find activities that align with those values.
* Consider where you want to be in the future and in the next 5 years.
* Consider where you are today, including your skills and resources.
* Connect those lines to find your path.

## Community is Hard to Find

* In school you have many communities, but after school, it all goes away.
* John fixed this by having brunch every week with friends.
* People are craving community, more chance they will respond to your invite.

## Be Your Own Best Friend

* If anyone else talked to me the way I talk to myself, I wouldn't allow it, and I'd cut them out of my life.
* I can choose what my voice says.
* To apply this to your life, recognize that conversation and your voice.
* Intervene it and try to talk to yourself like a friend.
* The new voice aka. the good one (in the 3rd person) will become the default way.
