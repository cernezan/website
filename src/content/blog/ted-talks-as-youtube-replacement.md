For the past few days, I've been enjoying some TED talks. During my [7-Day Internet Consumption Reset](https://www.cernezan.com/blog/7-day-internet-consumption-reset/), I wanted to find an educational medium that I could watch due to my YouTube restriction. Most of the TED talks I've watched are not only inspirational but also funny and interesting.

I believe consuming content like this ignites something within you. I've also noticed that I rarely watch more than 2 talks in one sitting, which great difference compared to YouTube.

Currently, I'm using the [TED app](https://www.ted.com/), which isn't perfect, and sometimes the videos don't play as expected. However, it's a much better alternative than watching TED talks on YouTube, where I'm just one click away from a 2h+ session. I always set English subtitles and adjust the playback speed (from 1.5x to 2x depending on the video and topic).

I know there are tons of amazing talks out there, but here are some of my favorites so far.

[Do schools kill creativity? by Sir Ken Robinson](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity)

[Your body language may shape who you are by Amy Cuddy](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_may_shape_who_you_are)

[What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness by Robert Waldinger](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness)

Enjoy!
