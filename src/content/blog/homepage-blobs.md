I'm currently working on my homepage. It's really hard to create something simple and clean, yet fun and playful. I believe that the homepage needs to be a bit special and have some fun elements for the first-time visitors. For the past two days, I've been playing around with animated blobs.

Currently, I have a few ideas for sections on the homepage:

\- **My Interests List** (with a simple chip design, similar to how categories are now displayed)

\- **Recent Posts** (to get some people to explore my blog)

\- **Featured Projects** (not sure what I'm going to display here since I don't have any active/interesting projects)

Here's a quick sneak peek at the blobs I was talking about.
