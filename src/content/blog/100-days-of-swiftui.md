I’m on day 12 of the [100 Days of SwiftUI course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), thanks to the recommendation of [Zhenyi Tan](https://mastodon.social/@zhenyi). I’ve decided to learn some Swift and SwiftUI so I can build a small app or create an interesting extension. The main idea is to be able to build something that might be useful to me. I also wanted to try something other than web development.

This course has got me feeling like I am back in learning mode, like when I was at university, where I had so much fun. When I finish it, I will definitely take more courses, perhaps in a different domain.

So far, the course has covered some basic programming concepts, which is okay even for someone who codes daily. However, I’m enjoying some Swift specifics, like structs, and I can’t wait until we get to some real app building soon.
