The floods in Slovenia, my home country, have preoccupied my thoughts for the past few days. My household isn't affected, but I empathize with anyone who is. It's dreadful.

I spent most of my day in front of a computer, watching the news, viewing images, and making some minor improvements to my website. I also went on a slow-paced 8km run to help clear my mind.
