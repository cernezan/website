Next Sunday, I have a 10km race in my hometown, so today I went on a simple run to check the route. Being so hot didn't help my run, but I guess I can expect similar temperatures next week during the race.

I also got inspired to start daily mood tracking by watching [Matt D'Avella's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA4-qQ5wEns). I'm not sure how long I'm going to do this, but I think reflecting on your day can be beneficial because it can help you connect with your emotions and feelings.

I also can't wait for [Apple's Journal app](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23738869/apple-journal-app-ios-iphone-wwdc-2023), which will substitute the current note-taking approach.
