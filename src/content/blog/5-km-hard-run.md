Today, I wanted to see how far I could push myself. So I did a 5km run as fast as I could. It was tough, and I thought I would be able to go a bit faster. I ran 5km in 26 minutes and 38 seconds. I know that if I dedicated more of my life to running, I could easily improve this time, but I'm happy with the current result considering the training done.
