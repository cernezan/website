Yesterday, I read "[Scoop: Vox Media drops its own CMS](https://www.axios.com/2023/07/18/vox-media-chorus)" and it got me thinking about just how powerful and dominant WordPress has become. Even large publishing organizations like Vox can't compete with it. I've used WordPress before and I think that despite its limitations, it's a great piece of open-source software. 

One of the most appealing aspects of WordPress's popularity is its simplicity, which enables people to start their own blogs with ease. Blogs running on WordPress are typically hosted using a web-hosting service, which in my opinion, is far superior to other locked-in blogging platforms. With WordPress, you're quite flexible in terms of where and how you host your website, and you can move at any time if your current web-hosting solution doesn't meet your standards.
