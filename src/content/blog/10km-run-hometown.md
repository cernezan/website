On Sunday, I did my 10km race in my hometown. It was hot at around 32 degrees Celsius, which made running even harder. To be completely honest, it was a hard race, but I'm happy and glad that I did it. I finally saw what I am capable of even in the most harsh conditions. At the same time, I'm happy that I didn't push myself to a point where a health emergency would be needed.

I will continue my running preparations for [October's event in Ljubljana](https://vw-ljubljanskimaraton.si/en), but I will shift my workouts more towards whole body exercises as well.
