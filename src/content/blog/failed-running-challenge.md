Today, I didn't go on a run since I was playing beach volleyball for over 2 hours. There's no excuse, so I guess I failed my [7 day running challenge](https://www.cernezan.com/blog/my-7-day-running-challenge/). I'm not disappointed, and I will go on a run tomorrow and on Sunday just to round things up. 

It was a nice challenge in general, but not that sustainable in the long run (no pun intended). Especially when my running preparations end and I go back to the gym for 3-4 days per week. However, even after my two 10km races, I will continue to run. Running has given me so much joy, activity, and happiness that it makes little sense to stop completely.
