As of right now, I no longer use Google as my main search engine on my smartphone. To be honest, I have no real reason for using it in the first place. I just didn't mind changing it. This is another example of the power of defaults at play. Even I, someone who prefers to use a different search engine than Google, have not changed it on all of the devices I use.

This just shows how powerful some of these defaults really are. I only noticed this because I used Google without an account signed in, and I got this whole page popover wanting me to sign in. Not only was this popover annoying, but I also felt violated. This just shows that Google's primary value of organizing the world's information is now completely replaced by improving their ad performance.

Note to myself - check and change the defaults to match my preference
