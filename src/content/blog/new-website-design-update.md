The new update went live yesterday. I'm quite happy with the design and the new updated look now. As usual, I already have a few improvements planned for the future.

This update brought a few changes that are the starting points for the next chapter of this website, which is going to be more content/user-focused. Here are a few new features:

* improved post preview on home page
* improved buttons
* improved README.md file on [Github](https://github.com/cernezan/website)
* new categories
* improved RSS feed style
* improved after post content with share buttons and recommended articles
* and a lot more

I want my writing to be useful and informative, and having a good design and blog-related features makes it more accessible.

I'm looking into implementing [View Transitions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/) onto my website. I still have to test it to see how it works, but [what I've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nctPgnXWOCw) so far looks promising.
