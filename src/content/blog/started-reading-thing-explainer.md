I've been reading ['Thing Explainer' by Randall Munroe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26721828), the creator of the webcomic XKCD. It has sparked more curiosity in me about the world.

The unique feature of 'Thing Explainer' is that it explains complex ideas and objects using only the 1,000 most common words in the English language. This approach [simplifies complex concepts](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Thing-Explainer), and I've been enjoying it much more than I initially thought I would.
