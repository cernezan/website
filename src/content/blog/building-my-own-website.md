The coolest thing about building my own website is that I can improve and iterate quickly. Today, I’ve noticed that the reader of the article might want to quickly return to the list of all posts, so I’ve added a simple button at the end of the article.

It’s just a button and it’s a small addition, but I love the feeling of accomplishment and seeing my website grow on a weekly basis.
