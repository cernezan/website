Yesterday, I went to see 'Oppenheimer' with friends. As expected, it was an amazing movie with a great screenplay, music, and actors. I really enjoyed it, but it's a complex film, almost like real life, filled with paradoxical characters and hard choices. It's hard to say anything more about the film without watching it again, since so many things happen. I particularly enjoyed the start of the film. Had it stopped there, it might have inspired the next generation of physicists.
