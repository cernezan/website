Today, while browsing Hacker News, I found an interesting [CPU guide created by a 17-year-old](https://github.com/hackclub/putting-the-you-in-cpu). I'm not sure how good is it, but it looks promising. I will definitely check it out over the weekend. Seems like it's going to be a fun weekend.

Additionally, I have some exciting website updates coming soon. I'm really enthusiastic about working on this website, and I hope that with the current and upcoming content, some of you will find it useful.
