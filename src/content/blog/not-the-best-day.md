What a strange day. Today I definitely don't feel like myself; my thoughts are all over the place. Despite all this, I'm grateful for my friends who can be so supportive in such moments. I've started listening to an episode from [Huberman Lab about 'Growth Mindset,'](https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-enhance-performance-and-learning-by-applying-a-growth-mindset/) and however uncomfortable that phrase sounds, the science behind it is quite fascinating. I'm taking notes, so I might publish something in that regard on the blog as well.
