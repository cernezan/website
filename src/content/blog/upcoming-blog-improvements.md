I need to start thinking about implementing pagination for this blog. I would also like to enhance the blog posts by adding some RSS feed links and more information at the bottom of each post. I like what I've built, but the current version of my blog is quite basic and barebone.

I've also just finished '[The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked)'. The title might not be the best, but it's definitely an interesting read. I might post some notes from the book in the coming days.
