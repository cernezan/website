Change only happens when it is most convenient for the individual.

I believe in climate change, and like many others, I believe it is one of the biggest problems of our generation. I also believe that the narrative around individual choice and action is flawed. In my opinion, blaming individuals was manufactured by corporations to shift the blame away from them and onto the individual.

It makes very little sense to recycle, drive an electric car, or use other means of transportation, eat less meat, and then see more than [200 private jets fly away within hours of the Super Bowl ending](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ssebrx/flight_map_showing_over_the_140_private_jets_that/). It's discouraging. You recycled for a year, only for a jet engine to undo all your hard work in minutes.

We, individuals, should feel shamed by our actions while every institution known to man is maximizing for the shareholder value, not reversing the effects of climate change. It makes people angry and I understand.

I'm not here to provide any solutions. However, there is hope in convenience. If something is more convenient, people will prefer it over the status quo. As a society, we need to design products and create things that are more convenient while also being better for the environment.

Electric cars, although not the perfect example, are a step in the right direction. When electricity gets cheaper and charging networks become more stable and accessible, people will switch, not because it's better for the environment, but because it will be cheaper than gas.

In 2021, I read a book by Bill Gates called "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster". If you're interested in this topic, I highly recommend it.
