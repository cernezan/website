Hey ðŸ‘‹,

my name is **Å½an ÄŒerne**. I'm a CS student at the University of Ljubljana. and design enthusiast. I'm fascinated by tech, however, I'm quite critical of centralized social media. I've realized how much I have grown in the past couple of years so I've decided to share some of my thoughts, experiences, experiments, interesting topics, and articles with anyone who visits my website. You can find my posts [here](https://cernezan.com/posts/).

I'm love reading books that make me just a bit smarter. One of my favorites must be [Permanent Record by Edward Snowden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=yQ0UUnciLj&rank=1). I'm thinking of creating a "book wall" on this website where I post all the books I read every year. I would also like to write about some ideas that I find interesting when reading, but I'm not super into making book summaries.

I also like sports especially running, volleyball, basketball, snowboarding, swimming, and more. I workout almost every single day and I believe that's one of the cornerstones of a healthy lifestyle.

As a student, I'm currently working at a company developing a web application for vehicle tracking and document management system.

## Technologies

I'm not a senior programmer and I have a lot to learn, however, I'm quite comfortable with a few technologies. I'm familiar with:

-   **Frontend**: Angular, Typescript, Javscript
-   **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB
-   **Design**: Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Lightroom

I'm a big fan of Linux however I use macOS as my daily driver.

## Projects

I had many different projects ranging from hobby startups to running a design blog. Since my interest are so spread out, I'm always working on something new. I'm a huge fan of running personal experiments so I can improve my skills, healthy and more. I would love to share some of my personal experiments on my blog.

## Let's Connects

I would love to hear from you. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. You can contact me via [email](https://cernezan.com/contact/).
