    <p>
        I appreciate your interest and am looking forward to connecting with
        you. Here's how you can get in touch. Scheduling a video call is a
        preferred method of contact for me, and I would be happy to meet you.
        You can also email me for any general inquiries, comments, or just to
        say hello. I typically respond within 24 hours.
    </p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
