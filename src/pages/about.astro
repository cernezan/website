            The best way to describe myself would be as a tech enthusiast with
            varying interests in other spheres. I've always been fascinated by
            everything at the intersection of technology, design and personal
            well-being. I enjoy learning about various topics, from computers to
            fitness and I feel fulfilled when I can use my knowledge to help the
            people around me.

            I enjoy building applications, extensions, websites, and more. I'm
